# Infrared Remote Control

![pew pew pew!](item:tis3d-additions:remote_control)

The remote control allows sending infrared packets directly from your hand. Powered by a solid-state lithium ion battery, and given the low energy draw per infrared signal, this device can be used for many years without having to be recharged.

The transmitted value is manufacturer-dependend and burned into flash during assembly.
